<h1>Biography</h1>
<img src="me.jpg" alt="Pic-of-me" width="200" height="200" >
<p>I was born and raised in Tinley Park where I attended Millennium. From there I went on to Grissom Middle School as I played football for the Tinley Park Bulldogs.I then went to Andrew High School until my junior year where I switched to Providence Catholic. Since I was ineligible to play football because of a certain rule, I was a team manager and helped out on the side with recording and helping with the play book. We won state that year which was very exciting. After high school I went to Moraine Valley Community college and worked at Five Guys in Orland Park. I worked and was given my Associates in Science and got a scholarship to Lewis University.</p>
